## Introduction

### installspi.sh

`installspi.sh` installs the SPI module as [DKMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support) (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) to preserve the module across kernel upgrades. The following changes are made to install the module properly:

+ The script determines your kernel version. If it's 6.12 or higher, it renames the header from `asm/unaligned.h` to `linux/unaligned.h` in `focal_spi.c` to compile the driver without fatal exception error.
+ The script updates `Makefile` by modifying `KERNEL_VERSION :=` and `KERNELDIR :=` by changing `:` to `?` to allow being rebuilt after kernel upgrades.

### installlib.sh

`installlib.sh` unpacks, modifies, repacks, and installs the latest libfprint package. These modifications are made because the official package has several issues:

+ The official package attempts to overwrite `fprintd.service` in `/usr/lib/systemd/system` directory. A package overwriting another packages' file(s) are discouraged since it'll cause several problems.
    + To fix this, the script deletes the conflicting file and adds `override.conf` which includes the changes from `fprintd.service` to `/debdir/etc/systemd/system/fprintd.service.d` directory. This is the recommended way to add override configurations by systemd.
+ The official package contains wrong *md5sums*. If the *md5sums* inside a Debian package is wrong, the package manager might detect a checksum mismatch and refuse to install the package.
    + To fix this, the scripts updates *md5sums* to ensure integrity checks pass.

## Installation

1. Clone [*ubuntu_spi* repository](https://github.com/ftfpteams/ubuntu_spi):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ftfpteams/ubuntu_spi.git
```

2. Copy `installspi.sh` and `installlib.sh` into the repository's root directory. The directory tree should look like this:
```bash
./ubuntu_spi
â”œâ”€â”€ focal_driver_open_test
â”œâ”€â”€ focal_spi.c
â”œâ”€â”€ installlib.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ installspi.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ libfprint-2-2_1.94.4+tod1-0ubuntu1~22.04.2_spi_20250112_amd64.deb
â”œâ”€â”€ libfprint-2-2_1.94.4+tod1-0ubuntu1~22.04.2_spi_amd64_20240620.deb
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

3. Make the scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x installlib.sh installspi.sh
```

4. Install the SPI Module:
```bash
./installspi.sh
```

5. ***Configure for UEFI Secure Boot (Skip to step 6 if Secure Boot disabled)***

> âœ“ Tip: This step is for initial installation only. If you're updating, you can skip this section!

If you have Secure Boot enabled on your PC, you might see this line after running `installspi.sh`:

```bash
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'focal_spi': Key was rejected by service
```

This means that you need to enroll a signing key to make the module trusted by Secure Boot. You will see the prompt *Configuring Secure Boot* for the first time:

i. Select `Ok`. Enter a password for Secure Boot.

> âœ“ Tip: If you didn't see the prompt *Configuring Secure Boot*, you can enter:
>
> ```bash
> sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
> ```
>
> and choose a password.

ii. Reboot. Upon system reboot, you will be greeted with *Shin UEFI key management*. Press any key to perform MOK management.

iii. Choose `Enroll MOK`, `Continue`, `Yes` and enter the password you've chosen earlier. Finally, `Reboot`.

6. Install libfprint:
```bash
./installlib.sh
```

7. When you see the prompt *PAM configuration*, make sure **Fingerprint authentication** is ticked, and select `Ok`. You can press Tab key to go below.

8. GNOME and GDM have native support for fprint, so you don't need additional configuration on Ubuntu. Go to **Settings > System > Users > Fingerprint Login** and enroll your fingerprint.  
If you are using a distro that uses SDDM such as Kubuntu, visit [SDDM#Using_a_fingerprint_reader](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM#Using_a_fingerprint_reader).

## Troubleshooting

### My PC stuck at login screen after installing libfprint

This may occur on distros like Debian Stable *bookworm* that ship outdated packages. libfprint conflicts with some of these packages, possibly GDM, and prevents from logging in. To recover your PC:

1. Boot into a live environment (USB installation media).

2. Gain root privileges:
```bash
sudo su
```

3. Use fdisk tool to list drives:
```bash
fdisk -l
```
Identify your partition that has your operating system installed by locating `Linux` or `Linux filesystem`. In this example, the drive is /dev/nvme0n1 and the partition that has the operating system installed is 2. So, the partition is **/dev/nvme0n1p2**:
```bash
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: SAMSUNG MZVL2512HCJQ-00B00
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 6CE694C6-8CE1-41E1-98DA-677436595609

Device           Start        End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/nvme0n1p1    2048    2203647   2201600     1G EFI System
/dev/nvme0n1p2 2203648 1000212479 998008832 475.9G Linux filesystem
```

4. Mount the partition. Replace *partition* with the partition you've identified such as **nvme0n1p2**:
```bash
mount /dev/partition /mnt
```

5. Change root:
```bash
chroot /mnt
```

6. Uninstall libfprint:
```bash
apt remove libfprint-2-2
```

7. Reboot.

## Updating and Uninstalling

To update, uninstall and reinstall. If only one of them received an update, you don't have to uninstall the one that didn't receive an update.

> ðŸ›ˆ Note: The scripts were updated. If you're uninstalling the older version (before 9 August 2025), visit [here](https://github.com/vobademi/FTEXX00-Ubuntu/tree/49c808374c75733278915bb87d19884efad16dc7#updating-and-uninstalling) for older commands.
### Uninstall the SPI module

1. Gain root privileges:
```bash
sudo su
```

2. Unload the module:
```bash
modprobe -r focal_spi
```

3. Remove from DKMS:
```bash
version_spi=$(dkms status | grep focaltech-spi-dkms \
| sed -E 's/^[^/]+\/([^,]+).*/\1/' | tr -cd '0-9.') \
&& sudo dkms remove -m focaltech-spi-dkms -v "$version_spi" --all
```

4. Remove source directory:
```bash
rm -rf /usr/src/focaltech-spi-dkms-*
```

### Uninstall libfprint

1. Uninstall libfprint:
```bash
sudo apt remove libfprint-2-2
```

2. Remove the hold to allow updates from official upstream (for uninstalling only):
```bash
sudo apt-mark unhold libfprint-2-2
```
